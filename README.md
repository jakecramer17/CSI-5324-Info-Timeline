# CSI-5324-Info-Timeline

The CSI 5324 Information Timeline is a web application for Baylor faculty to  
post announcements for students to see. Students will see posts either on  
TV screens around campus, or by navigating to the website.  

The Administrator role is held by a single faculty member, and has the responsibility  
of managing the creation of faculty accounts, and deciding which posts get  
onto the timeline. After navigating to the home page on a desktop or mobile  
device, the Admin can log in and see the posts that other faculty members  
have submitted for approval. After reviewing each post, the Admin can decide to  
either approve or reject it. Doing either will remove that post from the Admin's  
post queue, but approving a post will additionally cause it to appear on the public  
timeline. If a faculty member wishes to be able to make posts, then the Admin can  
create that person's account.

The Timeline User role, held only by faculty members, is the role that allows the  
creation of new posts on the timeline. After signing in, a Timeline User can navigate  
to a page that allows them to create a post containing a title, description, tags, and  
a type; announcement or event. After the filling out the information, the Timeline User  
submits their post for review by the Admin. Each Timeline User can see the posts  
they have previously submitted, and if a post hasn't been reviewed by the Admin,  
they also have the option of canceling it.
